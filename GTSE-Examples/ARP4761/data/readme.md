# Wheel Braking System Use Case: Configuration and Output Data

The files in this directory relate to the Wheel Brake System in Procter and Wrage's MODELS19 Paper "Guided Architecture Trade Space Exploration: Fusing Model Based Engineering & Design by Shopping"

The files are:

* `basic.txt`: The set of architecture candidates generated by the initial, random state exploration. Shown in the lower left and lower center of Figure 2.
* `cpuinfo.txt`: Detailed CPU information on the computer the use case was run on. More specifically, the output of running `cat /proc/cpuinfo` on the test machine.
* `full-sample.aadl`: The full AADL file which is excerpted in Listing 1.
* `pareto.txt`: The set of architecture candidates generated using the settings shown in the lower right of Figure 2. Also shown in Figure 3.
* `readme.md`: This file
* `request.properties`: The GATSE-generated request file used when executing GATSE on the wheel braking system.
* `wbs.ecf`: The GATSE-generated ATSV configuration file used when executing GATSE on the wheel braking system.
